Two ideas changed the world.  |
In 1448 in the German city    |
of Mainz a goldsmith named    |
Johann Gutenberg discovered a |
way to print books by putting |
together movable metallic     |
pieces. Literacy spread, the  |
Dark Ages ended, the human    |
intellect was liberated,      |
science and technology        |
triumphed, the Industrial     |
Revolution happened. Many     |
historians say we owe all     |
this to typography. Imagine   |
a world in which only an      |
elite could read these lines! |
But others insist that the    |
key development was not       |
typography, but algorithms.   |
