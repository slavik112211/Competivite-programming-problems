To add additional source folders to Eclipse:

1. Create a folder;
2. Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Source -> Add Folder (checkmark close to the folder);
3. Could also be done through modifying .classpath:
    <classpathentry kind="src" path="14 PermutationsCalculator"/>
    
4. Specify another Main class in the Run configuration.
